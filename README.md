## What is Matrix Pay
Matrix pay is another way of purchasing items that uses your face as authentification for a payment request through the VISA API.
First you have to train your face so that it is added to the database and can be recognized by the face recognition payment system.

## Use Cases
Imagine you are on a cruise hanging out by the pool and you want a drink. You walk to the bar ask for a drink and go to pay for it but you forgot your room card in the room. Well have no fear Matrix Pay is here, just stand in front of the camera, input your pin, and start the face recognition process and just like that you paid for your drink. This senario can be applied to any store, resturant, and market place.

## How to use Matrix Pay
1) Install the Matrix Pay app to your matrix by using the cli or dashboard `matrix install MatrixPay`
2) Download the IOS app on your IOS device, compile it through Xcode (Not on the app store).
3) Click the settings button at the bottom of the app to configure the ip address for it to connect to the Matrix Creator
3) Once you have everything started, click the register button on your IOS device and it will start training your face. Hold the Matrix Creator about 3 feet in front of your while it is training. Once it turns green that means it trained your face.
